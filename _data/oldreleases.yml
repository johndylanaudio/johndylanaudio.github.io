  description: This 18-track fan club exclusive chronicles the evolution of "Get Beyond," which began life as a riff and a title, "Kashmiri, Queen De La Sahara," then became a pop track called "You Can Get Beyond," before merging with a separate song called "What's Wrong?" and becoming the multi-part odyssey known as "Get Beyond." All of these songs are provided, plus you'll even hear the unfettered musings about "You Can Get Beyond" John dictated into his voice recorder (possibly while a bit stoned), imagining what it should sound like. You'll also hear the original demos, the test take from when John was thinking he would play a live drum set on the album, and all the rough mixes of the album version.
