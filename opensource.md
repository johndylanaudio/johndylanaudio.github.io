## The Open Source Music Approach

The idea of Open Source Music is to just open up the whole process of making and releasing music,
having a website, and playing shows, so that it is something that everyone can participate in. 
We believe that being connected to people on the internet is beautiful and a fine replacement for
the price-gouging, payola-driven, consumerist way that music was released in the past. 

By justloosening the grip a little on certain "intellectual rights," and by actively creating avenues
for participation, we hope that we end up being a really fun band to be into.

## In practice

Okay, so what does that mean, and how is it actually different?

It means you can use the multitrack information that I take care to include with every release, to remix or samples my songs all you want, release the results, and even charge people for your work, without ever paying us anything. All I ask is for attribution. 

If you wanna get all legalese about it, [read about the Creative Commons Attribution License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/).
  
## Are there any restrictions on what I can do with your music?

Only two. 

1. YouTube et al monetization might be problematic. We *have to* register our music with Rumblefish,
   a service which monitors sites like YouTube for uploads that have our music in them. That's because
   if we didn't, then when *you* uploaded your remix or derivative work, *our* uploads could be blocked
   in certain countries, blocked for monetization, or even taken down altogether. It just takes one person
   trying to monetize their stuff using a service like Rumblefish for this to happen.
   
   Please, hear us now: We will never ever file a copyright claim against you for uploading a remix or
   sample of our stuff, ever. The worst case scenario we're talking about here is that Rumblefish
   may detect a match and take over the monetization for your upload. We are so sorry
   if this ever impacts you; it's not our intention. But in this world of automated takedowns, we have
   to do this one thing to keep our uploads live. The best defense against all this is creating work
   that doesn't sound like our originals -- which we hope happens, anyway! Then, we hope, you can 
   monetize away. Thinking of all this in a more fun/badass way: you're basically trying to outsmart robots
   using only your powers of creativity.
2. We reserve sync licensing rights. Synchronization licenses are granted to people who make visual
   works such as movies, TV shows, and games, and synchronize your music with the events onscreen. They
   are granted by artist permission only, and we want to keep it that way. If you have an offer for
   selling a sync license for a remix / sample of our stuff that you made, let us know and we'll work
   something out. 
   
## Okay I'm ready!

Then go grab any of the Open Source Music releases from our Bandcamp! All the remixables/sample-ables are
in 24-bit/96k lossless format, which is what the material was natively recorded in, so it should hold up
well to whatever crazy manipulation you want to do to it.

As soon as you pick up any of the Open Source Music releases, these raw materials are included, and you're
off to the races.
